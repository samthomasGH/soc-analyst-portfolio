Ticket ID: SEC-2025-014
Priority: Medium
Incident Type: Malware – Suspicious PowerShell Dropper
Status: In Progress
Detected By: CrowdStrike Falcon (Suspicious Process Behaviour)

1. Summary

CrowdStrike detected a PowerShell script spawning from an unusual parent process on workstation WS-442, suggesting an attempted dropper or script-based malware.

2. Event Details

Device: WS-442

User: k.johnson (Finance)

Process:

C:\Users\k.johnson\AppData\Roaming\invoice_viewer.exe

Spawned PowerShell with obfuscated base64 command

Network activity: Attempted outbound connection to 45.77.192.44:8080

Files created: C:\Temp\ps_script.ps1

3. IOCs

IP 45.77.192.44 listed as C2-based infrastructure

Obfuscated PowerShell execution

Unknown executable masquerading as “invoice_viewer.exe”

4. Triage Performed

Reviewed file hash — not found in VirusTotal

Confirmed user received a phishing email with a fake invoice PDF

EDR behaviour blocked execution before payload delivery

Reviewed lateral movement — none detected

5. Containment Actions

Isolated endpoint via Falcon

Submitted suspicious files to sandbox

User account temporarily disabled pending password reset

Blocked outbound IP at firewall

6. Remaining Risk

Unknown whether payload attempted data exfiltration

Other users may have received the same phishing email

Invoice-style phishing campaign might target Finance specifically

7. Recommendations

Email Security team to search for identical phishing emails

SOC to create detection rule for similar PowerShell patterns

IT Ops to re-image workstation WS-442

Conduct Finance-targeted phishing awareness refresher

8. Next Steps

Awaiting sandbox analysis and email team sweep results. Not yet closed.
